# General documentation of the files contained here:

## generalUtils.py 
contains a few functions originally to analyze connectivity, but are used here for generating timeseries.Other functions can be added to this file. 

## createTimeseries.ipynb
This is a jupyter-notebook aimed to look at specific subject/run timeseries and average response for each event. It uses functions from generalUtils.py and mainly in a POC stage right now, so we should work to make it cleaner and more relevant for this specific project. This should be added as another stage in QA.
